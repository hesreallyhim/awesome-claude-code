# Donations

Maintaining this repository consumes a non-trivial amount of my time, energy, and financial resources. But it doesn't seem right to me to accept contributions or sponsors for a repository that mainly features other people's work. Instead, I've decided to direct anyone who wishes to support this repo financially to make a direct financial contribution to a non-profit that means something to me - if I'm able to raise money in this way, then I'll have additional motivation to continue to devote myself to maintaining this repo with the care and attention that it deserves.

The project I've chosen to support is [The Bail Project](https://bailproject.org/), which provides direct financial relief for cash bail so that people who are presumed innocent are not detained while awaiting a court date. Visit their website for much more information about cash bail and how they operate.

If you wish to donate to The Bail Project in honor of this repo, you may do so in the following way:
1) Go to https://bailproject.org/ and click [DONATE](https://bailproject.org/donate/) (or just scroll down to the Donate widget).

2) 
- Enter whatever amount you want to donate (amounts will not be published on the repo, although I will be notified if you elect to dedicate your donation to me, but any amount is generous).
- Select "One-time" or "Monthly".
- Check "Dedicate this donation" and enter "hesreallyhim" (if you want to be listed as a donor).
- Designate to "bail only" (optional).
- Click "Donate and Support"

Next screen:
- Enter your details (use your real name because this will be for your CC/PayPal/etc. info). Your personal details will not be published on this repo.
- Donate anonymously if you want. (optional) ("Anonymously" with respect to The Bail Project - donations dedicated to @hesreallyhim will not be anonymous - if you want to make your own anonymous contribution, that's awesome too.)
- Click "Continue".

Next screen (might not show up):
- See if your employer is registered with this program (it looks like GitHub is!).
- Click Continue or "skip to next step".

Next screen:
- Enter your payment details (CC, PayPal, Google Pay, Venmo, Bank, or BTC).
- Select "Cover transaction costs" to pay for the platform fee. (minimal fee - optional)

Next Screen:
- Click "Donate"

NEXT STEP (Don't worry, you're almost 10% of the way there):
- You will receive an email from The Bail Project saying: "Complete your dedication with a personal message".
- Click the link "Complete my dedication".

Next Screen:
- Fill out the information for the dedication email. Here, I think you can use whatever name/alias you want - but be sure to include the name of your resource/repo if you want to be listed as an awesome donor.
- At the bottom, enter my recipient information:
    - First Name: "Really"
    - Last Name: "Him"
    - Email: "hesreallyhim@proton.me"
- Click "Send email"

Done!!! ðŸŽ‰

I will then receive an email that looks like this:

**FINALLY**

Your project's name will appear in the list of donors and your list entry will get some special stylish recognition. (Design TBD)

It's really as simple as that. ðŸ™ƒ

This is a kind of experiment, because GitHub does not offer an official way to direct sponsors towards a charitable project unrelated to open-source software (understandable), so we'll see how this goes. If you do not support the social project that I've chosen to support, that's OK too, but please be respectful, as is already required by the Code of Conduct.
