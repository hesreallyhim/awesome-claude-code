# CC0 Foundation - Legal Basis for This Fork

## Overview

This repository is built upon commit `03cbd6b` (September 12, 2025) from the upstream repository hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code, which was released under the **CC0 1.0 Universal** license (public domain).

## Timeline

- **April 19, 2025**: Upstream repository created with CC0 license
- **September 12, 2025**: This foundation commit (`03cbd6b`) - **LAST CC0 COMMIT**
- **September 15, 2025**: Upstream changed license from CC0 to CC BY-NC-ND 4.0
- **October 27, 2025**: Fork created (after license change)
- **October 29, 2025**: This cc0-foundation branch created from pre-license-change commit

## Legal Basis

Under CC0 1.0 Universal, the original author (hesreallyhim) dedicated all copyright and related rights in the work to the public domain. This dedication is irrevocable:

> "Once the work has been made available to the public under CC0, the person who applied CC0 waives their right to any subsequent control or reliance on copyright or related rights."

**Key Points:**
1. Content released under CC0 remains in the public domain
2. Subsequent license changes by the author do not retroactively revoke CC0 dedication
3. This fork legally derives from CC0-era content (commits from April 19 - September 12, 2025)
4. All automation infrastructure (scripts, workflows) existed during CC0 period

## What This Means

This repository is built on:
- **Infrastructure**: GitHub Actions workflows, Python scripts, templates (all from CC0 era)
- **Content Structure**: CSV-based management, categorization system (from CC0 era)
- **Factual Data**: Project names, URLs, descriptions (facts are not copyrightable)

## What We're Adding

- **Original Fork Content**: GATEKEEPING analysis, documentation improvements by @thedotmack
- **Updated Factual Information**: New project submissions from community (facts only)
- **Our Own License**: CC0 1.0 Universal for maximum permissiveness and community benefit

## Verification
