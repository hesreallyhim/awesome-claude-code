# Content Promotion Skill

## Purpose
Promote completed projects across X and LinkedIn with optimized, platform-specific content.

## Workflows

### Full Promotion Pipeline
```
1. Gather assets:
   - GitHub repo URL
   - Screenshot or video from output/
   - Project description (1-2 sentences)
   - Key features (3-5 bullets)

2. Create X post (see template below)
3. Create LinkedIn post (see template below)

4. Post in order:
   a. Push to GitHub first (github-skill)
   b. Post on X (x-skill) with native video/image
   c. Post GitHub link as reply on X (keeps video preview)
   d. Post on LinkedIn (linkedin-skill)

5. Take screenshots of each post for records
```

### Video Post Strategy
```
1. Render video (video-editing-skill)
2. On X: Upload video natively (not YouTube link!)
3. Post GitHub link as REPLY (not in main tweet)
   → This keeps the video preview instead of link preview
4. On LinkedIn: Add video as media attachment
```

## Platform Best Practices

### X
- Start with hook emoji + bold statement
- 280 chars max for main tweet
- Thread for details (use "🧵" indicator)
- Native video > image > text for engagement
- 3-5 relevant hashtags
- Best times: 9-11 AM or 1-3 PM

### LinkedIn
- Open with personal hook (NOT "I'm excited to announce")
- Use line breaks (LinkedIn loves white space)
- Include call-to-action (question or feedback request)
- Tag relevant people/companies
- 3-5 hashtags at bottom
- Best times: Tue-Thu, 8-10 AM

## Content Optimization
- Video > Image > Text (engagement ranking)
- Show the result first, explain how after
- Use numbers ("Built in 2 hours", "3 key features")
- Create curiosity gap ("Here's what surprised me...")

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Video upload fails on X | Check: MP4, max 512MB, max 2:20 |
| LinkedIn post hidden | Avoid spam trigger words |
| Low engagement | Try different times, add visual content |
| Link preview overrides video | Post link in reply, not main tweet |
