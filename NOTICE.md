### Current Status: ⚠️ COMPLIANCE ISSUE UNDER RESOLUTION

The upstream repository is licensed under **Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)**.

**Key issue:** The "NoDerivatives" (ND) clause of this license prohibits the distribution of modified versions or derivative works. This fork, with its modifications and additions, currently does not comply with the upstream license terms.

### What We're Doing About It

We are committed to full legal compliance and are actively working to resolve this issue:

1. **Contacted upstream maintainer** to request relicensing under an open source license (MIT or Apache 2.0)
2. **Documented the issue** transparently in [LICENSE_COMPLIANCE.md](./LICENSE_COMPLIANCE.md)
3. **Paused accepting new submissions** until licensing is resolved
4. **Exploring alternatives** if relicensing is not possible (see LICENSE_COMPLIANCE.md for options)

### Timeline

- **2025-10-29**: Issue identified and documented
- **Next 2-4 weeks**: Awaiting response from upstream maintainer
- **Target resolution**: By end of 2025-11-15
