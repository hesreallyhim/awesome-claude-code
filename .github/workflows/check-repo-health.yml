name: Check Repository Health

# This workflow checks the health of active GitHub repositories listed in THE_RESOURCES_TABLE.csv.
# It verifies that repositories are still active and maintained by checking:
# - Number of open issues
# - Date of last push or PR merge
#
# The workflow will fail if any repository:
# - Has not been updated in over 6 months AND
# - Has more than 2 open issues
#
# Deleted repositories are logged but do not cause the workflow to fail.
