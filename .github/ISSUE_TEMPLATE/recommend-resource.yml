        ## Welcome! 👋

        Thank you for recommending a resource to Awesome Claude Code! This form will guide you through the recommendation process.
        Please make sure that you have already reviewed the CONTRIBUTING document as well as the CODE_OF_CONDUCT.

        **Resource Guidelines:**
        - Ensure that your resource is unique and provides genuine value to Claude Code users. (Review the existing resources before submitting.)
        - Avoid submitting resources that violate the Claude Code Usage Policy (to the best of your understanding).
        - Make sure that the project does not violate the licensing rights of other independent developers.
        - Recommendations will be closely scrutinized for security and potential risk.
        - Although most recommendations are submitted by the authors, you may submit any resource that you love.
        - The system does not allow resource submissions via the `gh` CLI.
        
        **Tips and Tricks for a Speedy Review:**
        - Please provide clear installation AND uninstallation instructions for any installable resources.
        - If your resource requires me to execute a bash script, you **must** provide me with a clearly annotated/commented version in which everything is documented clearly. I _can_ read Bash, but it hurts my eyes after a while.
        - Short examples or demos are tremendously helpful in the review process. If I can see it in action before I think about running it, you're way ahead of the curve.
        - If your resource requires elevated access or "--dangerously-skip-permissions", please make sure the user is aware of this(!)
        - If your resource involves making ANY network requests except to the Anthropic API, you **must** state that here.
        - Offering an auto-update functionality for a library may be a very nice convenience for people. (Similarly, `npx @latest`). However, this is also a known threat vector and will be viewed with caution.
        - If you are claiming that a resource improves Claude's capacity to perform some particular action - ***provide clear instructions explaining how to demonstrate it.*** Instead of listing 100 things that your framework/plugin/skill provides, better to pick one awesome thing it can do that makes it stand out, and explain how to validate that claim. That's not only helpful for me, but for any potential users.
        - Avoid submitting resources that are only a day or two old, have no stars, or were created for the specific purpose of being added to the list. Be advised that before I even look at your project, I will examine its commit history for any red flags.

        **Ask Claude for a Candid Review:**
        When I review your recommendation, I will ask my assistant Claude Code to perform a review (this is to assist me - I do not base my judgment on this review alone.) You can find the prompt in `.claude/commands/evaluate-repository.md`. I recommend that you run this evaluation yourself ahead of time.

        After submission, our automated system will validate whether your Issue is well-formed with respect to the requirements of the template, and post the results as a comment. (This is merely a formality and does not constitute a review.)

        Once your recommendation has been validated, you've done your job - go back to working on your project.
