# Template Message for Upstream Maintainer

## Subject: Request for Relicensing Discussion - awesome-claude-code

---

Hi @hesreallyhim,

Thank you for creating and maintaining awesome-claude-code. The validation system and curated list you've built provide significant value to the Claude Code community.

### Purpose of This Message

I'm reaching out regarding the fork at `thedotmack/awesome-claude-code`. During a recent review, we discovered that your repository is licensed under **CC BY-NC-ND 4.0**, which includes a "NoDerivatives" clause that prohibits distributing modified versions of the work.

This means our fork, with its modifications, is currently not in compliance with your license terms. We take licensing seriously and want to resolve this properly.

### Background on Our Fork

We created this fork to explore an alternative governance model:
- Automatic approval for submissions that pass validation
- Faster inclusion times for community contributions
- Open governance with multiple maintainers
- Same quality standards through your excellent validation system

Our analysis showed that many quality tools were waiting or rejected after passing validation, and we wanted to experiment with a different approach to see if we could serve those contributors while maintaining quality.

### Request for Discussion

We would like to discuss options for resolving this licensing issue:

**Option 1: Relicensing to Open Source**

Would you consider relicensing awesome-claude-code under an OSI-approved open source license like MIT or Apache 2.0? This would:

✅ Enable legitimate forks and community experimentation  
✅ Align with GitHub's collaborative development model  
✅ Allow the community to build on your excellent foundation  
✅ Maintain attribution requirements (BY clause)  
✅ Still protect your work from misuse through copyright

Many successful awesome-lists use MIT or CC0 licenses to encourage community growth while maintaining attribution. This would allow both our repositories to coexist and serve the community in our own ways.

**Option 2: Limited Permission**

Alternatively, would you be willing to grant specific permission for our fork to continue? We would:
- Provide prominent attribution to your original work
- Link back to your repository as the source
- Clearly distinguish our governance model from yours
- Not compete for the "official" awesome-claude-code designation

**Option 3: Collaborate on Changes**

If relicensing isn't possible, we could explore collaborating on incorporating some of our automation ideas into your repository, or finding other ways to work together.

### Our Commitment

Regardless of your decision:
- We will fully respect your licensing choices
- We have paused accepting new submissions until this is resolved
- We have documented the compliance issue transparently
- We will either obtain proper permission or take alternative approaches

### Why This Matters to the Community

Creative Commons licenses (especially NC-ND) are generally not recommended for software and data projects because:
- They prevent the collaborative development model that makes open source successful
- The "NoDerivatives" clause conflicts with GitHub's fork-and-improve workflow
- They're designed for creative works, not code and data

Open source licenses like MIT are specifically designed for collaborative software and data projects, making them more suitable for a community resource list.

### Next Steps

We'd appreciate hearing your thoughts on this. Some questions to consider:

1. Would you be open to relicensing under MIT or Apache 2.0?
2. If not, would you grant permission for our fork specifically?
3. Is there a different solution you'd prefer?
4. Would you like to schedule a call to discuss in more detail?

We're committed to finding a solution that works for everyone while respecting your intellectual property rights.

### Timeline

We're aiming to resolve this within the next 2-4 weeks. We understand this may take time to consider, and we'll wait to hear your perspective.

Thank you for considering this request. Your work has been valuable to the community, and we hope to find a path forward that benefits all Claude Code users.

Best regards,

[Your name]  
On behalf of the thedotmack/awesome-claude-code fork community
