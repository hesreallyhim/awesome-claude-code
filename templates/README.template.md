# [Awesome Claude Code](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code) 🤝 [Awesome Claude Code Agents](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code-agents)

<!--lint enable remark-lint:awesome-badge-->

<!--lint disable double-link-->

This is a curated list of slash-commands, `CLAUDE.md` files, CLI tools, and other resources and guides for enhancing your [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) workflow, productivity, and vibes.

<!--lint enable double-link-->

Claude Code is a cutting-edge CLI-based coding assistant and agent that you can access in your terminal or IDE. It is a rapidly evolving tool that offers a number of powerful capabilities, and allows for a lot of configuration, in a lot of different ways. Users are actively working out best practices and workflows. It is the hope that this repo will help the community share knowledge and understand how to get the most out of Claude Code.

### Announcements

- 2025-07-26 - Anthropic done done it again, and Claude Code now has another super-power in its arsenal - custom user Sub Agents! I was thinking I might add a little section at the bottom about this "agent" thing, but then I tried it, and I think they're amazing, and probably deserve their own repo, so come and check out [awesome-claude-code-agents](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code-agents) and get those submissions rolling in. Can't wait to see what people are getting up to already with this new tech.
- 2025-07-25 - The new-new submission workflow is up now, I've managed to make it about 4-5 times more complicated than it should be 😜 so check out [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md) if you'd like to submit a new resource.

Regarding content, we especially welcome:

- Proven, effective resources that follow best practices and may even be in use in production.
- Innovative, creative, or experimental workflows that perhaps are still being iterated upon, but have high potential value, and push the boundaries of Claude Code's documented capabilities and use cases.
- Additional libraries and tooling that are built on top of Claude Code and offer enhanced functionality.
- Applications of Claude Code outside of the traditional "coding assistant" context, e.g., CI/CD integration, testing, documentation, dev-ops, etc.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on how to contribute to this project. Or, fire up Claude Code and invoke the `/project:add-new-resource` command and let Claude walk you through it!

If you have any suggestions or thoughts on how to improve the repo, or how to best organize the list, feel free to start a Discussion topic. This is meant to be for the Claude Code community, and in general I prefer not to act on sole authority.

### A note about licenses

Because simply listing a hyperlink does not qualify as redistribution, the license of the original source is not relevant to its inclusion. However, for posterity and convenience, we do host copies of all resources whose license permits it. Therefore, please include information about the resource's license. Additionally, take note: _if you do not include a LICENSE in your GitHub repo, then by default it is fully copyrighted and redistribution is not allowed_. So, if you are intending to make an open source project, it's critical to pick from one of the many available open source licenses. This is just a reminder that without a LICENSE, your project is not open source (it's merely source-code-available) - it may of course still be included on this list, but this notice is to inform readers about the default rules regarding GitHub and LICENSE files. See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository) for more details.
