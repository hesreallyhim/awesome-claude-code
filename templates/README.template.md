# [Awesome Claude Code](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code) 🤝 [Awesome Claude Code Agents](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code-agents)

<!--lint enable remark-lint:awesome-badge-->

<!--lint disable double-link-->

This is a curated list of slash-commands, `CLAUDE.md` files, CLI tools, and other resources and guides for enhancing your [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) workflow, productivity, and vibes.

<!--lint enable double-link-->

Claude Code is a cutting-edge CLI-based coding assistant and agent that you can access in your terminal or IDE. It is a rapidly evolving tool that offers a number of powerful capabilities, and allows for a lot of configuration, in a lot of different ways. Users are actively working out best practices and workflows. It is the hope that this repo will help the community share knowledge and understand how to get the most out of Claude Code.

### Announcements

- 2025-07-30 - Quick Update: Still trying to iron out the submission flow (sorry for anyone that received duplicate "Congratulations!" issues). If you end up fighting any of the programmatic submission tools, just submit something that has all the necessary data, and I'll take it from there once approved. Other notes: (i) I think it would be really cool/fun to set up a "Claude Code Leaderboard", so feel free to weigh in on the [Discussion](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code/discussions/81); (ii) I'm still trying to figure out what to do about **SUB AGENTS**, and I've reached out to some of the other folks who have started similar repo's; (iii) Added a small section that will be updated with new submissions as they roll in.

### A note about licenses

Because simply listing a hyperlink does not qualify as redistribution, the license of the original source is not relevant to its inclusion. However, for posterity and convenience, we do host copies of all resources whose license permits it. Therefore, please include information about the resource's license. Additionally, take note: _if you do not include a LICENSE in your GitHub repo, then by default it is fully copyrighted and redistribution is not allowed_. So, if you are intending to make an open source project, it's critical to pick from one of the many available open source licenses. This is just a reminder that without a LICENSE, your project is not open source (it's merely source-code-available) - it may of course still be included on this list, but this notice is to inform readers about the default rules regarding GitHub and LICENSE files. See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository) for more details.
