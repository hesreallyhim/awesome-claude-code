### 🚀 **[Submit a new resource here!](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code/issues/new?template=recommend-resource.yml)**

It's easy! Just click the link above and fill out the form. No Git knowledge required - our automated system handles everything for you.

**How we evaluate submissions**

- First and foremost, best efforts are made to ensure that any resource on this list is free of malware, bloatware, or other unwanted risks.
- Second, being a _curated_ list, every entry is manually evaluated and "tested out" to see if it actually delivers value to Claude Code users. If you want an _un-curated_ list, you can find many great resources [here](https://github.com/search?q=%22claude+code%22&type=repositories&s=stars&o=desc).

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for the complete submission guide and review process.

For suggestions about the repository itself, please [open a general issue](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code/issues/new).

This project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct.md). By participating, you agree to abide by its terms. And although I take strong measures to uphold the quality and safety of this list, I take no responsibility or liability for anything bad that might happen as a result of these third-party resources.

## Growing thanks to you ❤️
