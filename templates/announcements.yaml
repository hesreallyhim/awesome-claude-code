        I've created a [DONATING](DONATING.md) page in case anyone want to support this repository. This is _not_ a GitHub sponsorship or a "Buy Me a Coffee" link - I'm trying something a little different. Hopefully it will work out.

        See the very bottom of the README for an overview, and check out the [DONATING](DONATING.md) page for details.

        **We get a lot of visitors here at Awesome Claude Code (currently about 100 new stars a day) - can we raise $100 for a good cause by the end of next week??**

        Let's see what this community can do!
