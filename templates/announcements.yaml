  text: |
    "Many thanks to user [fotgs](https://github.com/fotgs), who [brought to my attention](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code/discussions/318) that in a shocking last-minute turn of events, reminiscent of the "Miracle on Ice", it was announced on [GitHub](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/10671#issuecomment-3478185783) that \"the CC team has decided to **keep output styles working indefinitely**\", or until they change their minds, so to celebrate, I would like to invite users to give Output Styles another shot; and seeing as we only have one awesome Output Style on this list, I'm going to guarantee that by one week from now, we will have a minimum of **5 Output Styles** in that category - which means that if you use Output Styles and would like to share some of the ones that you have found the most awesome, you have a _pretty decent chance_ of joining the ranks of comrade [viveknair](https://github.com/viveknair) - and, in drafting this announcement, I happened to visit viveknair's profile, and found a pretty neat little Claude Code [CLI usage heatmap](https://github.com/viveknair/ccheatmap), so check it out!"
