        In my previous announcement, I encouraged people to submit resources that explored features specific to _Claude Code_. So Claude read the post (he checks the list a lot), and was like "hold my martini" - and as of version 2.0.20 it looks like we've got a **new** set of toys for users to play with: [**Agent Skills**](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills). So for now I'm going to be focusing a lot on figuring out what you can do with this new feature set, and Skills submissions will be prioritized. Watch this space for updates.

        I've managed at last to secure a dedicated, direct-link, one-click fundraising widget for my campaign to support [The Bail Project](https://bailproject.org/). See <a href="#support">Support</a> below for more details, and click [here](https://donor.bailproject.org/-/NPHKDQGP?member=SELFZPZN) to contribute.
