        When you publish a LICENSE file to your repo, you are asserting certain legal rights. Well, marketplaces are popping up left and right, and not all of them are respecting these rights. Rather than focus on the negatives, I'd like to give special praise to user [khaliqgant](https://github.com/khaliqgant), who recently submitted his project [prpm](https://prpm.dev) for inclusion in the list. `prpm` is something like a marketplace, but with ambitions to support interoperability between diferent providers as well. After I pointed out to him that I wasn't able to find any license information about the resources he was sharing, he very quickly took action and updated the UI so that in the same card where you view information about one of the resources on his platform, you can click directly to that author's LICENSE file - or even just view it in a dropdown! <br>
        <div align="center"><a href="https://prpm.dev/search"><img src="/assets/prpm-license-ui.png" width="600" /></a><br></div>
        In my opinion this is a pretty awesome thing to do for the community, and sets a great example for other people who are aiming to set up their own marketplaces. So thanks very much to khaliqgant for taking this whole "open source" thing seriously, and I hope you'll give his site a visit - and if you notice other sites that are failing to uphold this standard, I encourage you to kindly remind them of their legal obligations - frankly, I presume a lot of people probably just don't know what a specific LICENSE requires of them, so let's just assume that everybody is acting in good faith.

        > ...due to personal factors and social ailments such as "rent", I must be mindful of the time I devote to this project, which is non-trivial ... For now, I am temporarily suspending any commitment to maintaining the Issue submissions as a FIFO _queue_ of items that must be evaluated in a timely fashion. You are absolutely encouraged to submit your projects, and I respect everybody's hard work and will make my best effort to review submissions as they come in.
