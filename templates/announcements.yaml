#         Thanks to you beautiful people, the list is getting so big it barely fits on my iPod anymore. And now a new challenge appears: **marketplaces**. I was having enough difficulty keeping up with reviewing individual resources... what shall I do with a submission that consists of 50-1000 resources all smushed together? Well... [you tell me!](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code/discussions/275) Head over to the Discussions tab and let me know what you'd like to see going forward. **Your input means a lot to my decision-making.**

#         The one thing I really really don't like to see is visiting a Claude Code marketplace and finding a resource that I recognize from this list... but without any attribution or acknowledgement to the original author. When you publish a LICENSE file to your repo, you are asserting certain legal rights, for instance you might want everyone to have free access to what you produced, but so long as they give you some recognition. Well, marketplaces are popping up left and right, and not all of them are respecting these rights. Rather than focus on the negatives, I'd like to give special praise to user [khaliqgant](https://github.com/khaliqgant), who recently submitted his project `prpm` for inclusion in the list. `prpm` is something like a marketplace, but with ambitions to support interoperability between diferent providers as well. After I pointed out to him that I wasn't able to find any license information about the resources he was sharing, he very quickly took action and updated the UI so that in the same card where you view information about one of the resources on his platform, you can click directly to that author's LICENSE file - or even just view it in a dropdown!

#         As I mentioned - I have no idea what to do with marketplaces and this list - but in my opinion this is a pretty awesome thing to do for the community, and sets a great example for other people who are aiming to set up their own marketplaces. So thanks very much to khaliqgant for taking this whole "open source" thing seriously, and I hope you'll give his site a visit - and if you notice other sites that are failing to uphold this standard, I encourage you to kindly remind them of their legal obligations - frankly, I presume a lot of people probably just don't know what a specific LICENSE requires of them, so let's just assume that everybody is acting in good faith.

    - summary: "Review Policy - Reminder"
      text: |
        It occurs to me now that because I don't have a "living record" of these announcments, except in the git history, people are probably not aware of everything I've posted before. So, in order to clarify the current state of the repo, I'll just quote from a previous announcement, which still is "in effect":

        > In addition to this, due to personal factors and social ailments such as "rent", I must be mindful of the time I devote to this project, which is non-trivial ... For now, I am temporarily suspending any commitment to maintaining the Issue submissions as a FIFO _queue_ of items that must be evaluated in a timely fashion. You are absolutely encouraged to submit your projects, and I respect everybody's hard work and will make my best effort to review submissions as they come in.

        Some people seem to be unaware of this (well, because I don't leave these announcements up forever), but sadly I have not won the lottery since the date that I posted the announcement quoted above, and so I have to balance my own time that I spend working on this list with the time that I spend trying to secure income to prevent being homeless. Even despite that, I have managed to get through a number of reviews over the past week or two, even in the face of some difficulties and distractions about which I will not speak because I have my own duties to the GitHub community and to the developers who I spend a lot of time advocating for. Thanks! If you have any feelings or thoughts at all about this repo, I really encourage people to open discussion threads and participate in dialogue - I would love to know more about what this community is really like, and I do believe that the vast majority are probably very awesome and smart. For the others, you are welcome to participate as well, provided you abide by GitHub's guidelines and treat each other with respect. Besos!



    # - summary: "Petulant User"
    #   text: >
    #     You may see some activity from a disgruntled visitor to the repo. Out of respect, and not wanting to be a bully, I think it's best to just ignore it. If people have problems with, or suggestions to improve, the repository, you are encouraged to open a SINGLE Discussion topic (per "grievance", let's say) to discuss it, and you have to follow the Community Guidelines, the same way I do, that's my only demand. I've always invited that, actually. On the other hand, if it becomes a matter of trolling or a real distraction, I'll have to have it moderated, which I really don't want to do, because I'm not a nanny (no offense to nannies).
