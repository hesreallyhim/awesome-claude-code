- We've got a few new resources this week, and I've made some good progress on the backlog.

- I've created a [DONATIONS](DONATING.md) page in case anyone want to support this repository. This is _not_ a GitHub sponsorship or a "Buy Me a Coffee" link - I'm trying something a little different. Hopefully it will work out. See the very bottom of the README for an overview, and check out the [DONATING](DONATING.md) page for details.
