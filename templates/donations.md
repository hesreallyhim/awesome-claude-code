Sixth Screen:
- Fill out the information for the dedication email. Here, I think you can use whatever name/alias you want - but be sure to include the name of your resource/repo if you want to be listed as an awesome donor.
- At the bottom, enter my recipient information:
    - First Name: "Really"
    - Last Name: "Him"
    - Email: "hesreallyhim@proton.me"

Done!!! ðŸŽ‰

I will then receive an email that looks like this:

Your project's name will appear in the list of donors and your list entry will get some special stylish recognition. (Design TBD)

It's really as simple as that. ðŸ™ƒ
