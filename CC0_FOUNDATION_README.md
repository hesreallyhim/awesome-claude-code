# CC0 Foundation Branch

This branch was created from commit `03cbd6b` (September 12, 2025) - the last commit under CC0 license before upstream changed to CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

## Legal Basis

This repository is built on content that was **irrevocably dedicated to the public domain** under CC0 1.0 Universal:

- **Original upstream license**: CC0 1.0 Universal (April 19 - September 15, 2025)
- **Foundation commit**: `03cbd6b` dated September 12, 2025
- **CC0 dedication is permanent**: Once released under CC0, content remains in public domain regardless of subsequent license changes

## What This Means

1. **All automation infrastructure** (scripts, workflows, templates) from the CC0 period is public domain
2. **No derivative restrictions** apply to CC0 content
3. **Legal foundation** established for continued independent development
4. **Complete infrastructure** included: GitHub Actions, Python scripts, CSV management, templates

## Timeline

- **April 19, 2025**: Upstream repository created with CC0 license
- **September 12, 2025**: This commit (03cbd6b) - last stable CC0 commit

## License for New Additions

All new content added to this branch by @thedotmack is licensed under MIT License (see LICENSE_MIT file).

## Structure

- **Original CC0 content**: Complete automation infrastructure, workflows, scripts, templates
- **Factual information**: Project names, URLs, authors (facts are not copyrightable)
- **New additions**: Licensed under MIT, clearly documented

This approach respects upstream's license change while establishing a legal foundation for continued development based on public domain content.
