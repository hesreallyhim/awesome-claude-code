# Content Promotion Skill

## Purpose
Promote completed projects across multiple platforms (X, LinkedIn, GitHub)
with optimized content for each platform.

## Workflows

### Full Promotion Pipeline
```
1. Prepare assets:
   - Screenshot or GIF of the project
   - Short description (1-2 sentences)
   - GitHub repo URL
   - Video URL (if available)
   - Key features list (3-5 bullet points)

2. Create platform-specific content:
   - X post (280 chars max, with media)
   - LinkedIn post (longer, professional tone)
   - GitHub README update

3. Post in order:
   a. Push code to GitHub (github-skill)
   b. Post on X (x-skill)
   c. Post on LinkedIn (linkedin-skill)

4. Monitor engagement (optional):
   - Check likes/retweets after 1 hour
   - Respond to comments
```

\`\`\`
```

### Video Post on X
```
1. Render video (video-editing-skill)
2. Prepare tweet text (short, punchy)
3. Upload video:
   - Use X's media upload endpoint
   - OR use browser automation:
     a. Click compose
     b. Upload video file
     c. Wait for processing (can take 30-60 seconds)
     d. Add text
     e. Post
4. Add GitHub link in reply (to avoid link preview overriding video)
```

## Content Optimization Tips

### X Best Practices
- Start with a hook (emoji + bold statement)
- Keep under 280 characters for the main tweet
- Use thread for detailed explanations
- Post video natively (not YouTube link) for better reach
- Best times: 9-11 AM or 1-3 PM (target timezone)
- Use 3-5 relevant hashtags

### LinkedIn Best Practices
- Open with a personal hook (not "I'm excited to announce")
- Use line breaks for readability
- Include a call-to-action (question or ask for feedback)
- Tag relevant people or companies
- Best times: Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10 AM

### Cross-Platform Strategy
```
1. X: Short, punchy, with media (video/GIF preferred)
2. LinkedIn: Professional, longer, with personal insight
3. GitHub: Technical, complete documentation
4. Reddit: Honest, community-focused, no self-promotion feel
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Video upload fails on X**: Check format (MP4, max 512MB, max 2:20)
- **LinkedIn post not visible**: Check for spam trigger words
- **Low engagement**: Try different posting times, add more visual content
- **Link preview issues**: On X, post link in reply to keep video preview
