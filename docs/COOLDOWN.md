# Cooldown Protocol

The following protocol exists to ensure fairness for all visitors that wish to be featured on the list, and to protect the repository from spam and other interactions which compromise the maintainer's ability to serve the needs of GitHub users.

## The GOLDEN Rule: Recommendations MUST be submitted by human beings using the Resource Recommendation Issue form template via the GitHub Web UI

Submissions that do not satisfy this very reasonable requirement violate the [CONRIBUTING](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code?tab=contributing-ov-file) guidelines and the corresponding [CODE_OF_CONDUCT](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code?tab=coc-ov-file). As maintainer, it is my [responsibility](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code?tab=coc-ov-file#enforcement-responsibilities) to make sure these guidelines are being upheld, and to do so in a way that reflects the [requirements](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code?tab=coc-ov-file#enforcement-guidelines) in the Code of Conduct. 

The ones reading this are probably those least likely to be impacted by it. I'd like to thank everyone who supports this repository and makes a good-faith effort to contribute to it. If you believe that the automated processes that implement this protocol are unfairly or inaccurately affecting you, please leave a comment in the relevant issue (you don't need to re-open it), or contact the maintainer directly at awesome-conduct @ hesreallyhim.com

## Violations of The GOLDEN Rule

Violating "The GOLDEN Rule" will (a) cause the issue to be immediately closed; (b) initiate an automatically enforced "cooldown" policy for the account that created the issue. **Users are personally responsible for the activity of AI agents that they have instructed, or permitted, to act on their behalf.** This is something that is true in general, and is also a consequence of GitHub's policy regarding access tokens. Violations include:

* Submitting a resource recommendation without using the required Resource Recommendation issue template.
* Submitting a resource via the `gh` CLI. Alas, the CLI does not presently supopport the creation of issues using issue templates, which carry the labels that are used to manage the processing of issues. If this happens to serve as a deterrent against bot submissions, I can't say I'm terribly despondent about that.
* Although I have a lot of respect for some bots, only human beings are permitted to open issues in this repo. First of all, it's direspectful to Claude, who is supposed to be the star of the show; second of all, it is extremely obvious, and embarrassing.
* You may not recommend a repo unless it is at least 7 days since the first public commit.

What happens if any of the above requirements are violated:

1st Time: 1-day cooldown period (no more posts during this time) \
2nd Time: 2-day cooldown period \
3rd TIme: 4-day cooldown period \
4th Time: 8-day cooldown period

**"Cooldown"** - no interactions with the respository during this time. It corresponds to a temporary ban such as described in the Code of Conduct, and reflects the seriousness of respecting the Community Guidelines and Contributing Guidelines of any repository whatsoever. The conditions I've laid out are not hard to comply with by anyone who has visited the repository and read the CONTRIBUTING doc, which is, as a matter of course, your obligation to do before enngaging with a repository. GitHub is a very nice place, where people are held to a somewhat higher standard, and it's my responsibility to follow the rules of conduct that I have set out.

Violating the cooldown protocol will result in a ban that is deemed appropriate given the circumstances.

I hope other visitors and developers will support this stance, and may have seen how disruptive it can be when basic standards of conduct are not met.
