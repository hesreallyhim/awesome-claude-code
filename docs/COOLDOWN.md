# Cooldown Protocol

The following protocol exists to ensure fairness for all visitors that wish to be featured on the list, and to protect the repository from spam and other interactions which compromise the maintainer's ability to serve the needs of GitHub users.

## The GOLDEN Rule: Recommendations MUST be submitted by human beings using the Resource Recommendation Issue form template via the GitHub Web UI

Submissions that do not satisfy this very reasonable requirement violate the [CONRIBUTING](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code?tab=contributing-ov-file) guidelines and the corresponding [CODE_OF_CONDUCT](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code?tab=coc-ov-file). As maintainer, it is my [responsibility](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code?tab=coc-ov-file#enforcement-responsibilities) to make sure these guidelines are being upheld, and to do so in a way that reflects the [requirements](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code?tab=coc-ov-file#enforcement-guidelines) in the Code of Conduct. 

The ones reading this are probably those least likely to be impacted by it, but it is publicized in the interests of transparency. I'd like to thank everyone who supports this repository and makes a good-faith effort to contribute to it. If you believe that the automated processes that implement this protocol are unfairly or inaccurately affecting you, please leave a comment in the relevant issue (you don't need to re-open it), or contact the maintainer directly at awesome-conduct @ hesreallyhim.com
