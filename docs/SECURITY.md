# Security Policy

This repository does not export any executible software, and
it is, at the end of the day, just a Markdown file with a
lot of internal plumbing. No private information is collected
or stored, except such as can be found on public GitHub
repositories, or what is submitted by individual users
when recommending a resource for inclusion on the list.

For these reasons, the surface area of vulnerability for a
security incident is rather limited, and is almost entirely
limited to the credentials of the maintainer.

That being said, if you do notice any security flaws, risks,
or vulnerailities (even if they only potentially affect
the maintainer), you are welcome and encouraged to open a
private security advisory, which you can do so [here](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code/security/advisories/new).

## Security of Third-Party Resources

Any security vulnerabilities or incidents relating to any of the
third-party resources that are featured on Awesome Claude Code
should first and foremost be reported according to the security
policy of the respective third-party repository.

However, in order to assist in ensuring the safety and security
of the resources included here, you are strongly encouraged
to _also_ report any such vulnerabilities to the maintainer
of this repo. While it is outside of our capacity, or of our
obligation, to enforce or investigate third-party security
violations, we will take such reports seriously.

We take the same approach to any (undisclosed) risks
to users' privacy.
