# CC0 Foundation Notice

## Legal Basis for This Repository

This repository is built upon content from commit `03cbd6b` (September 12, 2025) of the upstream repository hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code, which was released under **CC0 1.0 Universal (Public Domain Dedication)**.

### Key Facts

1. **CC0 Dedication is Irrevocable**: Content released under CC0 remains in the public domain permanently, regardless of subsequent license changes to the source repository.

2. **Upstream License Change**: On September 15, 2025, the upstream repository changed its license from CC0 to CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 (a restrictive license prohibiting derivative works).

3. **Our Legal Position**: This repository is based on the CC0-era content (April 19 - September 15, 2025), which remains legally available for use, modification, and distribution.

### What This Means

- **All automation infrastructure** (scripts, workflows, templates) existed during the CC0 period and is legally available for use
- **Project listings and factual information** are not copyrightable regardless of license
- **Our additions and modifications** are licensed under MIT License for maximum openness

### Verification

Anyone can verify the CC0 status of our foundation commit:

```bash
git show 03cbd6b:LICENSE
```

This will display the full CC0 1.0 Universal text that was in effect when this content was created.

### Timeline

- **April 19, 2025**: Upstream repository created with CC0 license
- **September 12, 2025**: Commit `03cbd6b` - our foundation commit (still CC0)
- **September 15, 2025**: Upstream changed license to CC BY-NC-ND 4.0
- **October 27, 2025**: Fork created (inherited restrictive license)
- **October 30, 2025**: This repository rebuilt from CC0 foundation

### Our License

All content in this repository is licensed under the **MIT License** (see LICENSE file), which is compatible with building upon CC0 (public domain) content.

### Compliance

This approach respects both:
1. The CC0 dedication of the original work (which cannot be revoked)
2. The current restrictive license on upstream's post-September-15 content (which we do not incorporate)

We maintain full legal compliance while preserving the automation capabilities and community value of this awesome list.
